# Biosphere

Biosphere is a web application that provides tools to calculate your carbon footprint and sort your waste.

## Inspiration

Since the theme for the hackathon was *Technology for social good*, I decided I should make an app that raises awareness about the environment and helps people around the world to make small changes to their lifestlye for the betterment of our planet.

I wanted it to be simple yet powerful, adopting novel technologies such as artificial intelligence.

## Technology Stack

- SvelteKit
- Firebase
- Gemini
- Cloudflare

## Features

### Carbon Footprint Calculator

The carbon footprint calculator provides a means for people to estimate how much carbon dioxide they are emitting. It's meant to help people measure their progress as they make changes to their daily routine.

### Waste Sorter

Sorting waste is a cruical aspect when it comes to recycling. We can improve the efficiency of waste management if the public can easily sort their waste into different categories such as organic, recyclable, and landfill.

### Authentication System

The website not only serves content but also allows users to register accounts.

## Challenges

Initially, I intended this project to be a mobile application. However, I had to move my idea to a web application because targeting mobile devices introduced many complications that would make the development of my product slow.

## Achievements

A lot was achieved with this product. I was proud of how aesthetic and functional the website was. Some key milestones include:
- integrating computer vision for waste sorting
- creating a mathematical model for carbon footprint calculations
- adding an authentication system for users

## Learning Experience

As this is my first hackathon, I have to admit that I learnt many things in the process. It was my first time connecting a website to generative AI and using Firebase Authentication. I also had to do some prompt engineering when I was designing the waste sorter.
